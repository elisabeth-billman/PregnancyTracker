# Overview

This is a program to help me understand and be able to apply and write a program in the Kotlin language. This is the first part of the code that will eventually be developed and designed to be an app.

This program helps women keep track of their pregnancy by tacking their due date and displaying how many weeks pregnant they are. It also provides a weekly developmental fact depending on how many weeks pregnant a woman is and gives them a size comparison to how big their baby is.

# Development Environment

This was programed in Visual Studio Code 

This program is written in the Kotlin language. It is run using the java.time.LocalDate library to be able to use dates and the java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit library which allows the program to run a function to find the number of days between two dates.

# Future Work

* In the future I want to add a function to allow the user to input a date and have a function that automatically takes todays date
* Add better written functions, possibly combine the facts function and the size function into one single function.
* find ways to help the program run faster and more efficiently.
